# IV1350 - Object-Oriented Design

## Overview  
This repository contains my submissions for the **IV1350 Object-Oriented Design** course. The course consists of five seminars, each focusing on different aspects of object-oriented development, including analysis, design, implementation, and design patterns.

Each seminar requires solving specific tasks, submitting a report, and participating in peer reviews. The final seminar provides an opportunity to improve scores from previous seminars.
