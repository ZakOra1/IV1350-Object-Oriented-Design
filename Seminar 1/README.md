# Seminar 1: Analysis - IV1350 Object-Oriented Design

## Overview  
This folder contains my submission for **Seminar 1: Analysis** in the **IV1350 Object-Oriented Design** course. The seminar focuses on interpreting and clarifying a given specification through UML modeling and structured analysis.

## Contents  
- **Domain Model**: A UML domain model representing the *Process Sale* use case.  
- **System Sequence Diagram (SSD)**: A diagram illustrating the interactions for *Process Sale*, covering both basic and alternative flows.  
- **Report**: A written submission explaining the methodology, results, and evaluation of the analysis.  

## Tasks  
1. **Domain Model**  
   - Identify key concepts using **noun identification** and **category lists**.  
   - Define attributes and associations based on the *Process Sale* requirements.  
   - Evaluate the model using the provided assessment criteria.  

2. **System Sequence Diagram (SSD)**  
   - Represent the system's behavior for *Process Sale* using UML.  
   - Cover both basic and alternative flows.  
   - Justify design choices in the report.
